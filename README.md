# Yelp Star Predictions Using Restaurant Attributes

Yelp ratings help guide the decisions of millions of hungry people, but exactly what do these ratings measure? Well, first of all,
food quality. But also other things. Things that might not be so obvious up front, like whether a restaurant charges for wi-fi
or gives it away for free. From a massive dataset of 21,000 restaurants provided by 
[Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), I made a model using the LASSO method of linear regression to find out exactly what 
restaurant attributes helped, hurt, or had no effect on, a restaurant's rating.
